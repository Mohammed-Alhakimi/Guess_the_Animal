# Guess_the_Animal
During this JetBrains academy challenging project, I was able to gain a lot of knowldge about Binary Trees in JAVA, and using dependencies such as JCommander and Jackson. I have also practiced a little bit with the Builder and the factory design patterns. I have also learned a lot of features about tree traversals.

I have learned how to construct objects with Json, XML, and YAML. In addition to practicing with exception handling. After that, I practiced with some localization concepts.
